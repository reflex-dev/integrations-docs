# Descope Integration

The **Descope Integration** enables your app to leverage Descope’s full Customer Identity & Access Management (CIAM) features—visual authentication flows, identity management, SSO, MFA, tenant isolation, and more. Once set up, you can orchestrate secure user journeys across your application with minimal coding.

- Manage users, roles, tenants, and permissions via management APIs  
- Orchestrate onboarding, branding, and multi-tenant flows via drag-and-drop workflows  
- Sync user data with tools like HubSpot or Segment via built-in connectors
